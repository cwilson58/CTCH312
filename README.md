# Labyrinth of the Fleshless
VR Game for CTCH 312, code named "ScaryMazeVR"

## Software Required
[Godot v4.2](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)

[Oculus Software](https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/)

    Note only the Oculus Rift S has been tested. Newer Meta headsets should work via Meta Quest Link.

## Getting Started

To build from source, open the project in Godot 4.2 and allow all imports to take place. The Godot Open XR Toolkit will throw a few errors on first start.

From here, ensure the Meta PC app is running, then start from the main scene.

## How to play (spoilers!)
When you first load in, take some time to learn the lever puzzle on the wall and get a feel for how the torch responds to you.
The monster in this area also can not attack you, if you wish to get a closer look!

Navigate the maze, and find all four lever puzzles. These will unlock the doors you require to find the end of the maze.
At the end, you are given a choice that will each give you their own voice line. From here you will be placed into the credits scene where the only light is the credits!
